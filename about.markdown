## What Iâ€™m into

Iâ€™m mostly working on:
- **Self-supervised learning**
- **Planning with world models**


## Some ongoing projects

- Training transformers on **MIDI music**
- Planning in control environments with **differentiable world models**
- Approximating Neural Networks' **preimage** with polytopes


## A bit more

Iâ€™m originally from Trieste, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, temporarily based in New York City for a research internship at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (NYU), where Iâ€™m working on my masterâ€™s thesis.
