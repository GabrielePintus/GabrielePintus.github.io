During my time at the University of Trieste as a Master’s student in Data Science, I started thinking about having an experience abroad, specifically in the United States. This led to what I call Operation Yankee.

*I know “Yankee” is technically a stereotypical term for people from New York, but in Italy, it’s often used to refer to Americans in general.*

Several reasons led me to consider this path, and I believe sharing them might be helpful to others, or at least interesting to read.

- **US is the leading country in AI**: The investment in AI research and development in the U.S. is unparalleled. It's home to many of the world’s top universities and research institutions, which are at the forefront of AI innovation. At the moment, Europe hasn’t been able to keep up with the U.S. in terms of funding and research output.
- **Experience abroad**: I wanted to experience a different culture and way of life, which I believe is essential for personal growth. Living in another country helps you see things differently and understand issues from new angles. One thing I’ve learned is that every culture has its own merits and flaws—what matters is choosing the one that suits you best.
*(But not the MM-DD-YYYY date format, please.)*
- **Language skills**: I wanted to improve my English. Nothing is better than spending time in an English-speaking country. I had already studied English for many years, but I wanted to become more fluent and confident in my speaking abilities.
- **Mythbusting**: This is the funniest one. I don’t know why, but in Italy there’s a common belief that U.S. universities “don’t teach theory” and focus only on practical applications, usually said with a tone of disdain, as if to justify the idea that “our engineers are better because they study theory.”
When I hear this, I usually respond with a simple question:
“Do the U.S. have cars? Trains? Planes? Rockets? The internet?”
At this point, the person typically stumbles and replies with something like, “Well, yes, but…” and then starts coming up with unrelated arguments.
Since I like to verify things for myself, I decided to go to the U.S. and see how things really are. There's no need to say all these misconceptions are false.

To try to make this happen, I started reaching out to several professors at my university, asking if they had any contacts in the U.S. who might be interested in hosting me for a research internship. Eventually, I ended up contacting Prof. Alfredo Canziani.
The story of how I met him is a bit long, if you’re curious, you can read the full version in my other post: [How I Met Alfredo Canziani](/operation-yankee/2025/06/09/himac). It’s a funny story, and I think it’s worth sharing.
After a few messages, an interview, and a meeting in person in Trieste, he accepted me as a research affiliate. In return, I agreed to help him create the course Introduction to Deep Learning, which he would later teach at NYU and for which he was developing new material. 

So I started helping with the assignments for the students as a Teaching Assistant. I wasn’t even in New York yet, but I was already beginning to revisit the basics I had studied before, this time from a different perspective.
I’m not afraid to admit that, at first, I was a bit skeptical about the approach. I was used to a math-oriented style of teaching, where everything is derived from first principles and built up step by step. This course followed a completely different approach, and that initially made me uncomfortable.
But since I believe that “anything you learn is useful”, I set my doubts aside and began to embrace the new perspective.

In the second week of March 2025, I finally arrived in New York City. I was excited, but also a bit nervous. I had never been so far from home, and the only person I even remotely knew, prof. Canziani, wasn’t in the city during my first week there. 

> *Looking back, calling it “Operation Yankee” might have been more accurate than I thought!*

Despite that, I went to the NYU campus and started exploring the area. When I arrived at the office where I would be spending my time during my research stay, I found out that most people prefer to start around 10 AM. At 8:30 AM, I was the only one there. I tried to open the office door, but it was locked—and I didn’t have a key. So I had to wait for the other professor sharing the office with Prof. Canziani, Prof. Zint, to arrive and let me in.

I sat on the couch in the hallway, waiting for someone to show up, and started thinking about how I would integrate into this new environment.
Ironically, the first person I saw arrive was Yann LeCun. No pressure!
Of course, I already knew who he was, but I had never met him in person. Even though I was a bit embarrassed, I greeted him, and he smiled and greeted me back. Then I sat back down on the couch.
I waited for more than half an hour, but there was still no sign of Prof. Zint. After another fifteen minutes, I finally found the courage to go to Yann’s office. I introduced myself and asked if he knew whether it was possible to get a key to the office. He was very kind and personally walked me over to the office manager so they could let me in. It’s not every day that you meet a Turing Award winner and have him personally help you with your office key!

By the way, yes, this is how I met Yann LeCun.

After that, I made myself comfortable at Prof. Canziani’s desk, which he had left for me to use during that first week. I started investigating the research topics I would be working on. Some were related to things I had already studied, while others were completely new to me. There, my journey began.
Since then, every day has brought something new: papers to read, experiments to run, and a lot of ideas to explore. I’m still in the middle of this experience, and I don’t yet know exactly where it will lead. But I can already say it’s one of the most enriching and inspiring things I’ve ever done.
